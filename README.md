# hello-world
## My name is Sachit Patel.

My first repository on GitHub. Going through the tutorials. Honestly, I'm a bit frightened at how much there is that "must" be known.
It's rather daunting... I hope that in time, what I learn is sufficent and I hope to find the learning in of itself enjoyable.
The end-goals of products, a job, flexibility, and all that is cool as a product, I need to find enjoyment in this and navigate the processes first.
